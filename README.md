# Important Notice

## Submission Issue with Private Repository

Dear Examiner,

I encountered a technical issue while attempting to submit my assignment via a private GitHub repository. Specifically, I received a **500 Internal Server Error** when trying to push my code to the private repo. After several attempts to resolve the issue, I was unable to fix it in time for submission.

As a result, I have submitted my assignment in this **public repository** instead to ensure timely submission. I kindly request that you review my work here.

If you need any additional details or proof of the error, feel free to contact me, and I can provide screenshots or logs of the issue.

Thank you for your understanding.

Best regards,
